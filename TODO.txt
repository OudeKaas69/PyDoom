PyDoom:
- A launcher, and the ability to specify IWADs/PWADs to load in it.
- Configuration file.
- Take apart a port (Currently looking at PRBoom+) for stuff like rendering
  routines, and use it as a reference for implementing actual logic, once stuff
  is actually loading.

DoomRL Strategy Mod:
- Saves only occur between floors; Ask the player if they want to save their
  game after the intermission screen.
? Destructible doors. Would need dynamic map geometry to some extent.
