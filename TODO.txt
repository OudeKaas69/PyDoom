PyDoom:
>>> Configuration file.
- Take apart a port (Currently looking at PRBoom+) for stuff like rendering
  routines, and use it as a reference for implementing actual logic, once stuff
  is actually loading.

Doom:
- Predator effect for Spectres.
  [4:57 PM] Kate: hmm hmm.. Theoretically possible. It would require multiple
  rendering passes - First, one would have to stencil-render the demons using
  white against black, then do a normal scene render, then make a second scene
  render to a texture which is then warped with a shader, then the stencil map
  would be applied as an alpha map against the warped image, which is then
  applied on top of the normal image.

DoomRL Strategy Mod:
- Saves only occur between floors; Ask the player if they want to save their
  game after the intermission screen.
? Destructible doors. Would need dynamic map geometry to some extent.
