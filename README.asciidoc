PyDoom
======
A pure port of the game DOOM to the Python scripting language, aiming for
maximum flexibility through modding.

Running
-------
If you're running from source on Windows, make sure you have Python 3.4
installed beforehand. It will not run with earlier versions.

Since the package is mostly Python, very little is needed to build. Just run:

[source]
MakeZip.py resourcezip PyDoomResource.zip
setup_extensions.py build_ext --inplace

Everything else should take care of itself. You only need to run these once, or
if you change the resource zip directory or the C extensions, though you should
not ever need to.

If you're on linux or another system, you will need to modify
setup_extensions.py to point to your system SDL2 and glew packages. The ones
included are Windows-only.
