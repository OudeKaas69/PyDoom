To-do List
----------

PyDoom
~~~~~~
* *Configuration file*
* Level and object classes
* BSP handling
* Rendering module
* Basic game logic
* Get the game running
* Audio module
* Game-specific code
+
As minimal as possible - Everything should be _supported_, but the actual
level formats and such can vary, so the game type should mostly determine
just thing types, etc. How maps and behaviors are interpreted, as opposed to
how the game itself runs.

Doom
~~~~
* Predator effect for Spectres
+
_Theoretically possible._ It would require multiple rendering passes - First,
one would have to stencil-render the demons using white against black, then
do a normal scene render, then make a second scene render to a texture which
is then warped with a shader, then the stencil map would be applied as an
alpha map against the warped image, which is then applied on top of the
normal image.

DoomRL Strategy Mod
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Saves only occur between floors
+
Ask the player if they want to save their
game after the intermission screen.

* Destructible doors
+
Would need dynamic map geometry to some extent.
